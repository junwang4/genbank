Just found that some organisms share the same name (853 such cases, out of over 1 million). For example, bacteria has two entries in table taxNode; one has the rank of superkingdom, and the other one the rank of genus. There are 853 such cases of name sharing.

I need to fix it - it involves four tables (Annotation, taxNode, Organism_new, Organism_tax) and will take a while.


== 2014-05-30 ==

1. Added a column "tax_id" in table Annotation
2. Added a new table: Organism_new (which contains taxonomy details for a tax_id in Annotation)

fields in Organism_new: 

 tax_id
 tax_name
 rank
 top1_tax_id
 top1_tax_name
 top1_tax_rank
 top2_tax_id
 top2_tax_name
 top2_tax_rank
 top3_tax_id
 top3_tax_name
 top3_tax_rank
 bottom1_tax_id
 bottom1_tax_name
 bottom1_tax_rank
 bottom2_tax_id
 bottom2_tax_name
 bottom2_tax_rank
 bottom3_tax_id
 bottom3_tax_name
 bottom3_tax_rank
 content 

top1_tax is the taxonomy information for the "highest ancester" of the species given in the ORGANISM field of an annotation record. 

For example, here is the ORGANISM field of an annotation

 Danio rerio
 Eukaryota; Metazoa; Chordata; Craniata; Vertebrata; Euteleostomi; Actinopterygii; Neopterygii; Teleostei; Ostariophysi; Cypriniformes; Cyprinidae; Danio. 

"Danio rerio" is the species name,
    top1_tax_name : "Eukaryota"
    top2_tax_name : "Metazoa"
    top3_tax_name : "Chordata"
    bottom1_tax_name : "Danio"
    bottom2_tax_name : "Cyprinidae"
    bottom3_tax_name : "Cypriniformes"

3. We no long need to use the column "organismId" in table Annotation. Instead, we will use "tax_id".

For example, to get some taxonomy information for the annotation with GI=2, we can do this:

SELECT a.gi, a.definition, o.tax_name, o.tax_rank, o.top1_tax_name, o.top1_tax_rank, o.bottom1_tax_name, o.bottom1_tax_rank FROM Annotation as a, Organism_new as o WHERE a.tax_id = o.tax_id AND a.gi=2;

| gi | definition                                                 | tax_name   | tax_rank | top1_tax_name | top1_tax_rank | bottom1_tax_name | bottom1_tax_rank |

|  2 | B.taurus DNA sequence 1 from patent application EP0238993. | Bos taurus | species  | Eukaryota     | superkingdom  | Bos              | genus            |
