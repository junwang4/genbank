1. Added a column "tax_id" in table Annotation
2. Added a new table: Organism_new (which contains taxonomy details for a tax_id in Annotation)

 tax_id
 tax_name
 rank
 top1_tax_id
 top1_tax_name
 top1_tax_rank
 top2_tax_id
 top2_tax_name
 top2_tax_rank
 top3_tax_id
 top3_tax_name
 top3_tax_rank
 content 

top1_tax is the taxonomy information for the "highest ancester" of the species given in the ORGANISM field of an annotation record. 

For example, here is the ORGANISM field of an annotation

 Danio rerio
 Eukaryota; Metazoa; Chordata; Craniata; Vertebrata; Euteleostomi;...

"Danio rerio" is the species name,
its top1_tax is "Eukaryota"
its top2_tax is "Metazoa"
its top3_tax is "Chordata"

I may need to add three most specific ones too: bottom1_tax, bottom2_tax, bottom3_tax.
If you think they are useful, please let me know.

We don't need to use the column "organismId" in table Annotation anymore.
Instead, we will use "tax_id".

For example, to get the taxonomy information for an annotation with GI=2, we can do this:

SELECT o.tax_name, o.rank, o.top1_tax_name, o.top1_tax_rank
    FROM Annotation as a, Organism_new as o
    WHWERE a.tax_id = o.tax_id and a.gi=2
